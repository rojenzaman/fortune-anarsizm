Queue - a list of people to be added
====================================
Note that this list is subject to change. If you know an anarchist you want added to this list, or someone you see who does not belong here, please make an issue for it. I want a wide range of anarchists, including those who disagree with each other and are in direct conflict with each other.

Because the French anarchist fortune has a disproportionate number of French thinkers and artists, I am trying to balance the ratio with Spanish, Italian, American, English, German, Eastern European, and Russian anarchists. I am also going to look for anarchistic thinking in East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

The miscellaneous file allows for non-anarchists who had some ideas which are in the spirit of anarchism, for example Bertrand Russell and, er, J. R. R. Tolkien. However, explicit anarchists get priority.

Note: I am already done with the people included with the original English anarchism fortune, and am moving on to the people included with the french anarchism fortune.
