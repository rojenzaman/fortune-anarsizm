That the Communist sees in you the man, the brother, is only the Sunday side of Communism... If you were a “lazy-bones,” he would not indeed fail to recognize the man in you, but would endeavour to cleanse him as a “lazy man” from laziness and to convert you to the faith that labour is man’s “destiny and calling.”
