We must not only act politically, but in our politics act religiously, religiously in the sense of freedom, of which the one true expression is justice and love.

Justice, equality, fraternity, prosperity of men... if God exists, all these things are condemned to non-existence.

A person is strong only when he stands upon his own truth, when he speaks and acts from his deepest convictions.

Unity is the great goal toward which humanity moves irresistibly.

That patriotism which tends toward unity without regard to liberty is an evil patriotism.

Liberty without socialism is privilege and injustice; socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality.

Political freedom without economic equality is a pretense, a fraud, a lie; and the workers want no lying.

I am a fanatic lover of liberty, considering it as the unique condition under which intelligence, dignity and human happiness can develop and grow.

To revolt is a natural tendency of life. Even a worm turns against the foot that crushes it.

In general, the vitality and relative dignity of an animal can be measured by the intensity of its instinct to revolt.

If there is a state, there must be domination of one class by another and, as a result, slavery.
            ----+- Mikhail Bakunin -+----

The state without slavery is unthinkable - and this is why we are the enemies of the state.

When the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called "the People's Stick."

Even the most wretched individual of our present society could not exist and develop without the cumulative social efforts of countless generations.

The individual, his freedom and reason, are the products of society, and not vice versa: society is not the product of individuals comprising it; and the higher, the more fully the individual is developed, the greater his freedom.

No theory, no ready-made system, no book that has ever been written will save the world. I cleave to no system. I am a true seeker.

The peoples' revolution will arrange its revolutionary organisation from the bottom up and from the periphery to the centre, in keeping with the principle of liberty.

Man becomes conscious of himself and his humanity only in society and only by the collective action of the whole society.

The liberty of every individual is only the reflection of his own humanity, or his human right through the conscience of all free men, his brothers and his equals.

I can feel free only in the presence of and in relationship with other men.

I am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally free.

The freedom of other men, far from negating or limiting my freedom, is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and confirmation.

The state, therefore, is the most flagrant, the most cynical, and the most complete negation of humanity.
            ----+- Mikhail Bakunin -+----

This flagrant negation of humanity which constitutes the very essence of the state is, from the standpoint of the state, its supreme duty and its greatest virtue.

Since the birth of the state, the world of politics has always been and continues to be the stage for unlimited rascality and brigandage.

There is no horror, no cruelty, sacrilege, or perjury, no imposture, no infamous transaction, no cynical robbery, no bold plunder or shabby betrayal that has not been or is not daily being perpetrated by the representatives of the states, under no other pretext than those elastic words, so convenient and yet so terrible: "for reasons of state."

We are firmly convinced that the most imperfect republic is a thousand times better than the most enlightened monarchy.
            ----+- Mikhail Bakunin -+----
%
In a republic, there are at least brief periods when the people, while continually exploited, is not oppressed; in the monarchies, oppression is constant.
            ----+- Mikhail Bakunin -+----
%
While we prefer the republic, we must recognise and proclaim that whatever the form of government may be, so long as human society continues to be divided into different classes as a result of the hereditary inequality of occupations, of wealth, of education, and of rights, there will always be a class-restricted government and the inevitable exploitation of the majorities by the minorities.
            ----+- Mikhail Bakunin -+----

The state is nothing but this domination and this exploitation, well regulated and systematised.

The liberty of man consists solely in this: that he obeys natural laws because he has himself recognized them as such, and not because they have been externally imposed upon him by any extrinsic will whatever, divine or human, collective or individual.

Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought. In the matter of boots, I refer to the authority of the bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or engineer.

The second element of freedom is negative. It is the revolt of the individual against all divine, collective, and individual authority.

I hate communism because it is the negation of liberty and because for me humanity is unthinkable without liberty. I am not a communist, because communism concentrates and swallows up in itself for the benefit of the state all the forces of society, because it inevitably leads to the concentration of property in the hands of the state.

Is it not plain that all these governments are systematic poisoners, interested stupefies of the masses?
