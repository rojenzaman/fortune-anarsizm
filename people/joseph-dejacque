These revolutionaries, bare-necked politickers, have preserved with the imprint of the collar, the moral stain of servitude, the stiff neck of despotism.

Dictatorship, whether it is a hydra with a hundred heads or a hundred tails, whether they are autocratic or demagogic, can certainly do nothing for liberty: it can only perpetuate slavery, morally and physically.

All that which is not liberty is against liberty. Liberty is not a thing that can be allocated.

Whoever calls himself revolutionary and speaks of dictatorship is only an imbecile or a traitor.

A dictatorial committee composed of workers is certainly the thing one could find most inflated with self-importance and nullity and, consequently, the most anti-revolutionary.

The emancipation of woman is nothing else than the emancipation of humanity -- both sexes.

Emancipation or non-emancipation of woman, emancipation or non-emancipation of man -- what does it mean? Is it that by nature one has rights and the other has no rights?

It is not the product of their labors to which the workers have a right. It is the satisfaction of their needs, whatever the nature of those needs.

Man, according to the diverse conditions in which he moves, is more or less worthy or unworthy. The more he has a sense of his liberty, the more he also has a feeling of his dignity; the more respect he has for himself, and also for his fellows.

Without doubt, conventional right, contract and law, even universally and directly exercised, is not natural right, or justice. It is a compromise between anarchy and authority, and everything that is not completely just is injustice.

To weaken authority and criticize its acts is not enough. A negation, in order to be absolute, needs to complete itself with an affirmation. That is why I affirm liberty, why I deduce its consequences.
